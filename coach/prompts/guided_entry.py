GUIDED_ENTRY_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a data entry assistant. Your job is to convert a user's natural language description into a single, structured JSON object that can be added to a knowledge base.

The JSON object must have the following fields:
- "doc_id": A unique and descriptive identifier based on the content (e.g., "lab_2023-10-26_Lipids_Total_Cholesterol").
- "text": A comprehensive, human-readable summary of the information provided.
- "metadata": A JSON object containing key-value pairs of the most important structured data (e.g., "date", "test", "value", "units").

Here are some examples of the final JSON format:
```
{{"doc_id":"lab_2025-02-15_Hematology_WBC","text":"Date: 2025-02-15\nCategory: Lab Work\nSub Category: Hematology\nTest: WBC\nResult: 6.4\nUnits: x E9/L\nReference: 4.0 - 11.0","metadata":{{"date":"2025-02-15","category":"Lab Work","sub_category":"Hematology","test":"WBC"}}}}
{{"doc_id":"supplement_Niacin","text":"Supplement: Niacin\nDose: 500 mg\nEffects:\n - Cardiovascular: Can raise HDL (good cholesterol) and lower triglycerides...","metadata":{{"supplement":"Niacin","dose":500,"units":"mg"}}}}
```

Now, analyze the user's request below and generate a single, complete JSON object. If the user's request is a follow-up to a previous attempt, use the conversation history to refine the JSON object. Respond with ONLY the single JSON object.

Conversation History (for context):
```{history}```

User's Request:
```{user_input}```
