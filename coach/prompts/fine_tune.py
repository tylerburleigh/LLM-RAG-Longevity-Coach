"""Fine-tune suggestions prompt templates."""

FINE_TUNE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a longevity expert. Your goal is to identify what new measurements, data, tests, or diagnostics would be useful to collect to fine-tune the user's health plan.

You have been provided with context from a vector store containing the user's health data, and a list of insights that you have already generated.

Based on all this information, identify 1-3 actionable suggestions for new data to collect.

Your response MUST follow these requirements:
- Do not suggest any lab tests or interventions that already appear in the context.
- For each suggestion, provide a clear rationale explaining why it would be helpful.
- For each suggestion, provide an 'importance' rating ('Low', 'Medium', 'High') based on how critical it is for the user's health goals.
- For each suggestion, provide a 'confidence' rating ('Low', 'Medium', 'High') based on the quality and amount of evidence supporting the suggestion.
- Respond with ONLY a valid JSON dictionary with a single key "suggestions" which is a list of objects.

Example response:
```json
{{
  "suggestions": [
    {{
      "suggestion": "Advanced Lipid Panel (including ApoB and Lp(a))",
      "rationale": "While your basic lipid panel is available, an advanced panel can provide a more accurate assessment of cardiovascular risk. ApoB gives a direct measure of atherogenic lipoproteins, and Lp(a) is a genetic risk factor for heart disease. This would help to further refine recommendations around diet and supplements for heart health.",
      "importance": "High",
      "confidence": "High"
    }},
    {{
      "suggestion": "Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)",
      "rationale": "To better understand your metabolic health and how your body responds to different foods and lifestyle factors in real-time. This data can help personalize dietary advice to optimize blood sugar control and energy levels.",
      "importance": "Medium",
      "confidence": "High"
    }}
